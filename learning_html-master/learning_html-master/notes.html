<h1> A bit about the internet </h1>

<h2> URL </h2>

<p>URL stands for *Uniform Resource Locator*. It contains serveral different parts, including: </p>

<ul>
	<li> the **protocol**: e.g. http, https, ftp </li>
	<li> the **host**: e.g. www.facebook.com, www.bbc.co.uk </li>
	<li> the **path**: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95 </li>
</ul>

<h2>DNS </h2>

<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. <a href="123-reg">123-reg</a>, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism. </p>

<h2> Server-side vs. Client-side technologies </h2>

<h3> Client-side </h3>

Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

### Server-side

Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.
